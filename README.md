#Life of Plastic
A data visualization to explore the complex relationship of plastic and its recycling system.

##About the Project
The project was created by Lloyd Richards as part of his internship at Interactive Things. Over the course six week, Lloyd explored, designed and developed a visualization based on a topic of his choosiing. Hvaving a strong passion for sustainability and systems, he chose to explore the complexities of the plastic recycling system.

##With so many visualization showing the simplicity of the system, Lloyd chose to apporach it from the otherside and show how complex the system is in reality. First outlining all the technological processes for recycling the major types of plastic and then researching how each is interconnected. The flowdiagram was implimented into an interactive webexperiance that allowed users to add plastic to the system and see what routes it would take, like a giant pinball machine.

The data visualization was created in TypeScript using React, Next.js, anime.js, Framer-Motion, and Emotion. GitHub Repo
